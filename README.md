### Purpose

You can't bring pets into libraries? Your friends are too busy to study with you? You live
alone? Well fret not! This poro will bring you joy and company when you need it!

>Apart  from  giving  companionship  to users  [Wilks  2010],  virtual  pet  games  have
been  applied  as effective  applications  to  promote  user’s  physical  and psychological
health  (e.g.,  healthy  eating  [Byrne  et  al.  2012], asthma  self-management
[Lee  et  al.  2010],  increasing  social interaction  [Pering  2002],  and  learning
social  norms  and behavior [Hildmann et al. 2008])

This project was created to provide users with a virtual companion to alleviate their
emotional states, especially in times of distress. Having to work alone in front of a 
computer for the entire day can become boring and lonely, so why not have a companion
to keep you company?

Research has shown that virtual pets are able to promote learning, collaboration, and 
empathy among users. The importance of these skills in our daily lives cannot be stressed 
enough, whether we are taking care of family members, working on a project with others, or 
developing lifelong relationships with people. As social creatures, humans crave 
interactions—it is the base upon which we function.

It's always nice to have someone accompany you in front of your computer even as you're 
rushing to complete an assignment by the deadline or bingeing Youtube and Netflix videos.
What's even cooler is being able to witness that someone grow with you throughout time and
develop a bond with you!

Not to mention children would **absolutely** love to have a companion on their computer
screen! This is a fun way to bring the magic of programming to them! By having a fluffy
creature living on their computer screen, they would feel like the *coolest* kid on the 
planet! We bet you they would.

This is a fun project we decided to create to bring a smile to people, especially during 
these lonely times in quarantine. We hope you enjoy!
