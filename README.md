Introducing a desktop **poro** that you can watch and interact with!

>Apart  from  giving  companionship  to users  [Wilks  2010],  virtual  pet  games  have
been  applied  as effective  applications  to  promote  userâ€™s  physical  and psychological
health  (e.g.,  healthy  eating  [Byrne  et  al.  2012], asthma  self-management
[Lee  et  al.  2010],  increasing  social interaction  [Pering  2002],  and  learning
social  norms  and behavior [Hildmann et al. 2008])

This project was created to provide users with a virtual companion to alleviate their
emotional states, especially in times of distress.

Research has shown that virtual pets are able to promote learning, collaboration, and empathy
among users.
